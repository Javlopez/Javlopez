### Javier Lopez Lopez
# Javier · Senior Software Engineer

**15+ years architecting scalable microservices platforms and leading high-performing engineering teams.**

Currently building enterprise-scale event ticketing infrastructure with Go microservices, implementing DDD, Clean Architecture, and advanced distributed systems patterns.

## What I Do Best

**Backend Architecture** · Expert in designing and implementing complex microservices using Go and Python. Specialized in RBAC systems, dependency injection patterns, Redis caching layers, and eliminating N+1 queries through optimized bulk operations.

**DevOps & Cloud Infrastructure** · Deep expertise in Kubernetes, Docker, AWS (EKS, EC2, RDS, S3, Lambda), and CI/CD automation (GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, FluxCD, Jenkins). Implemented monitoring solutions using Datadog, Prometheus, and Grafana that reduced MTTR by 60%.

**Technical Leadership** · Led engineering teams up to 20 members while maintaining hands-on coding responsibilities. Established engineering culture, implemented Agile/Scrum practices, and built CI/CD pipelines that reduced deployment times from hours to minutes.

**Performance Engineering** · Track record of critical migrations (Python-to-Go, PHP-to-Python) delivering 40% performance improvements and 60% memory reduction. Specialized in database optimization, caching strategies, and distributed system patterns.

## Recent Technical Highlights
