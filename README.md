### Javier Lopez Lopez
#### Head of Engineering

With few studies 13 years ago I began to work professionally always being self-taught,the experience through the years in different companies made me increase the quality of my work day by day, becoming a leader of engineering since 6 years

At the same time I began to be interested in programming in different languages and doing infrastructure, achieving successful migrations to Amazon AWS. My interests in technology have even led me to write code for mobiles using flutter, although lately my interest is focused on containers(Kubernetes/Docker), infrastructure, technical leadership.
