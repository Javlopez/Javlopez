# Hey, I'm Javier

**Senior Software Engineer** with 15+ years building scalable backend systems and leading engineering teams.

Currently architecting Go microservices for enterprise event platforms while exploring Rust and contributing to [Rook-Ceph](https://github.com/rook/rook).

## What I Build

🏗️ **Backend Architecture** – Designing high-performance microservices with Go, Python and PHP. Using DDD, Clean Architecture, RBAC, dependency injection, and distributed systems patterns. Built REST and gRPC APIs processing millions of requests daily.

☁️ **Cloud Infrastructure** – Kubernetes orchestration, AWS (EKS, EC2, RDS, S3, Lambda, CloudFront, Route53), Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible, Packer), and GitOps deployments (ArgoCD, FluxCD).

🔄 **Event-Driven Systems** – Architected message-driven architectures using RabbitMQ and AWS SQS for asynchronous processing and microservice communication.

📊 **Observability & Performance** – Implemented full-stack monitoring with Datadog/Prometheus/Grafana and ELK Stack that reduced MTTR by 60%. Specialized in database optimization, Redis caching strategies, and query performance tuning.

💾 **Distributed Storage** – Core contributor to Rook-Ceph project. Deep expertise in distributed storage systems, cluster management, and Kubernetes storage integration.

🔧 **DevOps Excellence** – Built CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI) reducing deployment time from hours to minutes. Implemented zero-downtime deployments and comprehensive testing strategies (unit, integration, E2E).

👥 **Technical Leadership** – Led teams up to 20 engineers while staying hands-on. Established engineering culture, Agile/Scrum practices, and mentored developers across multiple projects.

🤖 **ML/NLP Integration** – Developed microservices integrating custom NLP libraries and AI models using LangChain and prompt engineering techniques.

## Recent Wins

- Architected company-scoped RBAC system with granular role-based permissions
- Migrated Python services to Go → 40% performance boost, 60% memory reduction
- Built Redis caching layer eliminating N+1 queries across microservices
- Optimized database queries processing billions of records, significantly reducing latency
- Implemented background workers for payment processing and inventory management
- Established Goose-based migration system with safe rollback capabilities
- Led cloud migration to AWS optimizing costs and resource management
- Transitioned legacy apps to containerization (Docker + Kubernetes) improving scalability
